This is host code for use with bluetooth_rxtx firmware.

These tools link to libbtbb (http://libbtbb.sourceforge.net/).  Svn trunk
should always work the latest git verions of libbtbb.  Libbtbb can be built as
follows:

$ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/libbtbb/code libbtbb
$ cd libbtbb/
$ make
$ sudo make install

ubertooth-util: various utility functions including reboot into bootloader DFU
mode.

ubertooth-lap: sniffs a single Bluetooth channel and outputs LAPs of observed
packets.

ubertooth-dump: dumps a raw Bluetooth symbol stream from an Ubertooth board.
If you pipe it into xxd, you should see various ones and zeros.  If you pipe it
into dd, you can find out the transfer rate (should be 1 MB/s).  Timestamps are
dumped to stderr.
