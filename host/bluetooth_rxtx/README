This is host code for use with bluetooth_rxtx firmware.

ubertooth-dump.c: dumps a raw Bluetooth symbol stream from an Ubertooth board
running the bluetooth_rxtx firmware.

Usage:

./ubertooth-dump | ../bt_simple/btrx.py -b -i -

You must have gr-bluetooth installed.  This btrx.py is taken from an older
release of gr-bluetooth.  We'll fix that at some point, perhaps with changes
in gr-bluetooth, perhaps by moving a bunch of the gr-bluetooth code here or
into a new library.
