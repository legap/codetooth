This is host code for use with bluetooth_rxtx firmware.

ubertooth-lap.c: sniffs a single Bluetooth channel and outputs LAPs of observed
packets.

This links to libbtbb in the gr-bluetooth repository.  Somefeller needs to
learn me how to put together this here Makefile properlike.

ubertooth-dump.c: dumps a raw Bluetooth symbol stream from an Ubertooth board.
If you pipe it into xxd, you should see various ones and zeros.  If you pipe it
into dd, you can find out the transfer rate (should be 1 MB/s).  Timestamps are
dumped to stderr.
