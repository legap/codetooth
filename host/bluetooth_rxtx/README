This is host code for use with bluetooth_rxtx firmware.


REQUIRED SOFTWARE

These tools link to libbtbb > 0.8  (http://libbtbb.sourceforge.net/).  Svn trunk
should always work the latest git verions of libbtbb.  Libbtbb can be built as
follows:

$ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/libbtbb/code libbtbb
$ cd libbtbb/
$ gmake
$ sudo make install

This software also requires libusb 1.0 or higher:

THE TOOLS

ubertooth-util: various utility functions including reboot into bootloader DFU
mode.

ubertooth-lap: sniffs a single Bluetooth channel and outputs LAPs of observed
packets.

ubertooth-uap: sniffs a single Bluetooth channel and determines the UAP of the
device withe the LAP specified on the command line.

ubertooth-dump: dumps a raw Bluetooth symbol stream from an Ubertooth board.
If you pipe it into xxd, you should see various ones and zeros.  If you pipe it
into dd, you can find out the transfer rate (should be 1 MB/s).  Timestamps are
dumped to stderr.

ubertooth-specan: ouputs signal strength data suitable for feeding into spectrum
analyser software. e.g.

 ubertooth-specan -G -q | feedgnuplot --stream 0.5 --domain --3d 

will use feedgnuplot to drive gnuplot to draw a realtime animated 3D plot of the
frequency spectrum.
