This is host code for use with bluetooth_rxtx firmware.

These tools link to libbtbb from the gr-bluetooth git repository.  Note that
libbtbb can be compiled and installed separately from the rest of gr-bluetooth
and does not require GNU Radio to be installed.  Example:

$ git clone git://gr-bluetooth.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/gr-bluetooth/gr-bluetooth
$ cd gr-bluetooth/src/libbtbb/
$ make
$ sudo make install

ubertooth-lap: sniffs a single Bluetooth channel and outputs LAPs of observed
packets.

ubertooth-dump: dumps a raw Bluetooth symbol stream from an Ubertooth board.
If you pipe it into xxd, you should see various ones and zeros.  If you pipe it
into dd, you can find out the transfer rate (should be 1 MB/s).  Timestamps are
dumped to stderr.
