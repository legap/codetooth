Ubertooth Python Bindings
=========================

Contributed by Kane Mather


Installing
----------

    python setup.py build

This will create the build/lib directory. Within it you will see 
ubertooth.so

Usage
-----

The following code must be run as root

    import ubertooth
    
    for i in ubertoot.lap_sniffer():
        print "%06x" % i

The Code
--------

It sucks. This is the first time I've done anything in C. Don't hate.

...you'll notice this when you see I've resorted to using goto 
statements

TODO
----

* There's very little error checking. This needs fixing
* The C code probably sucks. Needs peer review :)
* I'm too tired to find more problems. I'll think of more tomorrow
