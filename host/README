This is proof-of-concept test code for Ubertooth.  Expect many changes over
the coming months.

Usage:

./ubertooth-dump | ./btrx.py -b -i -

You must have gr-bluetooth installed.  This btrx.py is taken from an older
release of gr-bluetooth.  We'll fix that at some point, perhaps with changes
in gr-bluetooth, perhaps by moving a bunch of the gr-bluetooth code here or
into a new library.

If you have a USRP, you can use demod.py to produce test input for btrx.py -b.

As an alternative to using ubertooth-dump, you can use a usb serial driver to
communicate with the Ubertooth.  For example in Linux you can unload the
usbserial driver and reload it with:

modprobe usbserial vendor=0xffff product=0x0005

Then you can talk to the Ubertooth with a terminal program such as minicom.
When you use the usbserial driver instead of ubertooth-dump, data transfer
speed will be restricted - too slow for streaming rx but good for testing
other things.  See the firmware source code for things you can do here.  All
this is subject to change, of course.
