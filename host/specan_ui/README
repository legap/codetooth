specan_ui.py is a basic spectrum analysis tool for the Ubertooth.

Requirements (or "what I developed with"):

  * libusb 1.0.8
  * PyUSB 1.0.0-a1
  * Qt 4.7.3
  * PySide 1.0.2
  * Python 2.6.6

It's only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.7, so far, but *should* execute nicely on other platforms.

Execute with:

$ python specan_ui.py

...and enjoy the show.
