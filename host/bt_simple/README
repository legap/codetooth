This is proof-of-concept test code for Ubertooth.  Expect many changes over
the coming months.

ubertooth-simple.c: dumps a raw Bluetooth symbol stream from an Ubertooth board
running the bt-simple firmware.

Usage:

./ubertooth-simple | ./btrx.py -b -i -

You must have gr-bluetooth installed.  This btrx.py is taken from an older
release of gr-bluetooth.  We'll fix that at some point, perhaps with changes
in gr-bluetooth, perhaps by moving a bunch of the gr-bluetooth code here or
into a new library.

If you have a USRP, you can use demod.py to produce test input for btrx.py -b.
