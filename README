This is Project Ubertooth, an open source wireless development platform
suitable for Bluetooth experimentation.  Ubertooth is primarily a hardware
product, but sample firmware and host code (software to be executed on a
general purpose computer connected by USB to an Ubertooth board) are provided.

The first hardware revision is called Ubertooth Zero and was demonstrated at
ToorCon 12 on October 24th, 2010.

The second hardware revision is called Ubertooth One and is unfinished.
