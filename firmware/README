For testing a new board, the recommended sequence is:

	1. install bootloader using ISP (e.g. Pogoprog) or JTAG

	2. use bootloader to install and test the following applications in
	sequence (see ../host/usb_dfu/README):

		a. blinky
		b. cc2400_test
		c. clock_test
		d. usb_test
		e. bluetooth_rxtx

The preferred firmware for Bluetooth functions is bluetooth_rxtx.

The default hardware target is Ubertooth One.  If you are compiling for
Ubertooth Zero, you must set the environment variable BOARD=UBERTOOTH_ZERO.
