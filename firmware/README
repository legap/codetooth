For testing a new board, see: assembly_test/README

The general purpose firmware including Bluetooth functions is bluetooth_rxtx.

This firmware is intended to be compiled with a particular toolchain:

	https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

If you are using a recent Ubuntu or Debian system, the toolchain can be installed
from their apt repositorities as follows:

    apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

The default hardware target is Ubertooth One.  If you are compiling for
Ubertooth Zero, you must set the environment variable BOARD=UBERTOOTH_ZERO.
