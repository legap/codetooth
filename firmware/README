For testing a new board, the recommended sequence is:

	1. blinky
	2. cc2400_test
	3. clock_test
	4. usb_test
	5. bluetooth_rxtx

The preferred firmware for Bluetooth functions is bluetooth_rxtx.  The
bt_simple firmware is deprecated.

The default hardware target is Ubertooth One.  If you are compiling for
Ubertooth Zero, you must set the environment variable BOARD=UBERTOOTH_ZERO.
