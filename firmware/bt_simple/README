bt_simple.c performs very simple Bluetooth functions controlled by a USB serial
interface.  The interface is similar to that of usb_test.c.

You can use the bt_simple/ubertooth-simple host code with this firmware.

As an alternative to using ubertooth-simple, you can use a usb serial driver to
communicate with the bt-simple firmware.  For example in Linux you can unload
the usbserial driver and then reload it with:

modprobe usbserial vendor=0xffff product=0x0005

Then you can talk to the Ubertooth board with a terminal program such as
minicom.  When you use the usbserial driver instead of ubertooth-simple, data
transfer speed will be restricted - too slow for streaming rx but good for
testing other things.  See the firmware source code for things you can do here.
All this is subject to change, of course.
