Project Ubertooth 2012-10-R1 Release Notes

The Ubertooth host utilities in this release require libbtbb-2012.10.R1 or
greater, it can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/libbtbb/files/

These are just the highlights.  For a complete list of changes since the
previous release, see the git log.

 - libubertooth

   The core Ubertooth functions are now packaged as a library, which allows us
   to have some independence between the core ubertooth functions and the tools
   that use them, such as ubertooth-* and the kismet plugin.  This should also
   help with future binary packaging.

 - Firmware flashing

   The ubertooth-dfu tool now attenpts to identify Ubertooth devices and put
   them in to firmware upgrade mode.  Multiple arguments can also be passed to
   ubertooth-dfu and will be executed in the order specified ont he commandline.
   To flash firmware on to an ubertooth device, use the following command:
     ubertooth-dfu --write <firmware_image.dfu> --detach

 - Bluetooth Low Energy (Experimental)

   Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Smart) sniffing is experimentally supported
   by the ubertooth-btle tool. The tool can be used to sniff the connection
   setup procedure between devices; promiscuous sniffing is available but is
   extremely experimental. Credit for this achievement goes to Mike Ryan.

 - Ubertooth-follow

   Ubertooth-follow has been added to the set of Ubertooth commandline tools.
   It retrieves the clock value from a local device using libbluetooth (bluez)
   and uses the Ubertooth to hop in time with the piconet.  To build
   ubertooth-follow use "make clock_debug=true".

 - Git
 
   Since the last release we have moved the source repository from SVN to Git.
   This should not affect the released code, but makes life easier for those of
   us working on the code.
